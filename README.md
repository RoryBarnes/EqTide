This code calculates the evolution of 2 bodies experiencing tidal evolution in the "equilibrium tide" (ET) format. Two models
are presented here, the constant-phase-lag or tidal Q, model, and the constant-time-lag model. Use the makefile to compile, then run
> eqtide -h to see the list of options. More updates to follow.
